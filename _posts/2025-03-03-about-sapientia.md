Sapientia is an online platform created for academic exchange and serves as the Curriculum Vitae of Woohyeon Chae. In the Archive, you can find a variety of materials produced through study and research, including Lecture Notes, Research Papers, and Theses.

We hope you have a great time exploring Sapientia. Thank you.
